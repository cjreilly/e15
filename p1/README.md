## notes for instructor
This project follows Design C of the form design flows proposed in the notes. A main index file ./index.php includes an index controller. The index controller includes an index view. A web user submits forms to a process file in the process directory. The process file processes the request, stores results as session data and redirects the web user to a view file. In this project, the process file redirects the web user back to the index view.

There is a view/parts directory for an expando part, which expands and contracts when a web user clicks a link. There is some additional CSS and Javascript for a web experience that is not required to interact with the project.
