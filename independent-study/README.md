# Independent Study
+ By: *Christopher Reilly*
+ Production URL: <http://independent-study.christopherreilly.me>

This is a PHP web application that displays a set of notes. The notes are formatted and include controls to make it
easier to reference them.

The triangle character on the right-hand side of some links is a filter control.

The home character in the navigation bar is a control to return to the home page.

Links reference specific sections on the page. If the section is not visible the link does nothing.

The web application builds the index from a JSON database.
